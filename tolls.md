Adding these estimates together:
€0 (Finland) + €0 (Baltics) + €15 (Poland) + €14 (Hungary) + €9 (Romania) + €10 (Bulgaria) + €50 (Greece) = **€98**

This estimate provides a good indication of your toll expenses, allowing you to factor them into your overall travel budget. Remember that vignette prices are usually fixed for a period (e.g., 10 days, weekly), so even if you're in a country for only a day or two, you'll need to purchase the shortest available vignette.
